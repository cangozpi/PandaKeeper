# PandaKeeper
comp305 Panda Keeper group project

TO DO LIST

1- Discussing about the project and trying to find a solution.
---> Assigning pandas to spots
---> Assigning spots to pandas
2- Creating a framework that reads the input files
3- Defining basic classes that we will use such as Panda, Spot, PandaArea
4- After reading the Input files send the fields to the solutions class and pass them to the solution methods.
5- After calling the solution methods in the main class the programm outputs the correct results.
6- Prepare different test cases to test programm.
7- After testing edge cases distribution is not correct for multiple neighbours.
  New Methods : 
  -->Updating assigning pandas
  Using Distance Vector principles counting the neighbour pandas, look after each neighbours bamboo count and distribute by taking from the most feed neighbour.
  -->Brute force with recursion
  
  -->Random Method
  
Results for:

Input 1 : 4, 0
Input 2 : 0, 0
Input 3 : 0, 0, 10
Input 4 : 1

How to run the code : 
There are 4 Input files , which our Input Parser class reads. Userss need to manually change the desired Input file in order to get the necessary output. File name should be changed in Buffered Reader declaration.
